## Week 2

We spent awhile learning about p5js, and whats different from processing.

I haven’t actually used p5js much yet, but am kinda looking forward to it. I’m gonna remake my Christmas tree.

The reading about AARON was very interesting, I liked reading about computers making art, and I really liked seeing how it grew and changed over the years. I’m interested in seeing if it can go any further.

As for NoPaint, I am not happy with that link. It is way too distracting, and I am already very distractable. My favorite effect was the swirl, I left it running and just watched it. I just wish it had more effects, and while I get the idea behind it, I wish there was a way to pick effects as well.
