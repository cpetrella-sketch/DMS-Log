## Week 3

I forgot to save my changes the first time :(

I made a Jigglypuff creature, because I am not artistic, and Jigglypuff is basically round. I did put effort into the eyes though. My move method looks rather spastic, it isn't very good. Next time, I want to incorperate some of the ideas from the reading.

Does this have spell check? I think I mispelled something.
