These are two of my Hydra creations. I like kaleidoscopes alot. I think I'll keep trying to try having more colors, like a physical kaleidoscope. I think Hydra is easy once you know how it works, but you need practice to really use it at it's best. Overall I think prefer p5js. I find it easier to understand personally, but I do think it takes less code to make intricate designs in Hydra, like the moving ones.
