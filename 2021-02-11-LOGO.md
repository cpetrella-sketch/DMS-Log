## Week 1.

Today we used LOGO, mainly the turtles. It brought back memories of the old Mining Turtle mod from minecraft. I was always so impressed by what some youtubers could program with it. Unlike those youtubers, I managed to break the screen.

Like that. It looks like it’s going to cut me. I want to go find those old mods now and see what I can make it do now.

Programmed walk (in minecraft)

Repeat 10 times.

Go forward 2 blocks.

Take the turn with most Red.

Started inside, so I went to a location that had blocks. Landed near a river, started walk from there. After I decided to turn right out of the parking lot. 

3rd repetition.

Ok, so there is red in two directions, but one has brighter red… consider bright red as more than orange-ish red.

4th.

My computer is not happy with me right now. I hope this doesn’t crash. Found a market, but surprisingly, the most red I see heads away from there.

5th.

Under a bridge now. Also, crossed a wide road. Glad there aren’t cars in this. Not much red this time. I guess I’m going toward where I see more bricks?

6th.

Had to climb over a road divider. Found another river at the end of it. I… think a building is apparently on fire nearby? I see the most red in that direction, as well as “smoke”. I’ll find out soon.

7th.

Yeah, it was on fire. There were fire trucks though, so that’s good. I’m under a bridge again, and I see exit signs. Apparently this city took 400 people nine years to make. Walking around like this, I can believe it. That’s an issue… the only red I see is a corner building… I guess I’ll go for the orange?
if there is no red, walk toward the most orange.

preemptively, if not that, yellow, then green. Follow the rainbow order.

8th.

Ok, so there was red this way. I found a brick fire station. I’m… not impressed, all the trucks seem to be in there still, and I just passed a fire. On the plus side, I see red again, so deciding which way to go is easier!

9th.

Under an overpass. Again. They really like these. I think I’m in a commercial area? The buildings are smaller, and I saw a billboard. Theres a really large building ahead, and I think I’m going that way. Wonder what it is.

10th.

So. My laptop held out just long enough. I walked through a tunnel that went through the big building. Still not sure what it was… I could see parking inside as I walked past though. Ended up in… not a super interesting area. I feel cheated. The most interesting thing was what I think was an on-ramp for one of those overpasses.
As a whole, this worked better than I thought it would. I saw some actually interesting things, although its kinda creepy in a way. Its like everything froze in time. I might try this again some other time though.
