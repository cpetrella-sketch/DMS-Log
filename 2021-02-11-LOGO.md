## Week 1.

Today we used LOGO, mainly the turtles. It brought back memories of the old Mining Turtle mod from minecraft. I was always so impressed by what some youtubers could program with it. Unlike those youtubers, I managed to break the screen.

Like that. It looks like itâ€™s going to cut me. I want to go find those old mods now and see what I can make it do now.
