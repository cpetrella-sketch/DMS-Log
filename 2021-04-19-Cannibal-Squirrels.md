The goal was to create a video game like Agar.io or Katamari. Unfortunately, our group didn't quite manage to accomplish this goal.

I think part of this is that none of us were used to group work, and so had issues all working together on the project. Both in meeting up, and splitting up the work. I'm thinking of taking the Social Systems course to get more practice next semester.

The link to what we did manage to make is here:
